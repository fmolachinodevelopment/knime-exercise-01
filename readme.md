## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.2, and install the following, best under a python virtual enviorment (venv)
- `pip install robotframework`
- `pip install --upgrade robotframework-seleniumlibrary`

## Running the Test Suite
To run the test suite, open cmd CLI, then navigate to the root of this directory and execute the following line:
- `./run_robot.bat Tests/TestSuite.robot`

This will run the `TestSuite.robot` and create an output directory in which the logs and reports will be created.
Future executions of the .bat will overwrite the already created reports.
